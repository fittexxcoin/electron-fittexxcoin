        # Phase 2:  This is the callback for the network request in phase 1.  Here we take the payload of transaction ids,
        # iterate through it, and make a network request to fetch the full raw tx.  Theoretically,
        # the full raw tx could have been returned along with the txid, but the server side developers
        # decided it is better to a seperate call.  In the phase, we also put a "lastblock" item onto the queue
        # that tells the system that the current chunk is complete.
        #
        # Phase 3:  This is the callback for the network request in phase 2.  The Raw tx is put into a queue for processing.
        # We use a queue structure so we can easily deteremine when all the callbacks have been completed.  Perhaps this phase
        # could have been combined with phase 4 but this is a cleaner design to handle this as separate phase.
        #
        # Phaase 4: In this phase, we iterate through the raw transaction queue and process each transaction.  We attempt to
        # extract the private key from the transaction and if successful, import it into the wallet keystore.  When we encounter
        # the "lastblock" item, we know the current chunk has finished processing, and we can update the rpa_height in the wallet,
        # which will allow phase 1 to process the next chunk, and so on.
