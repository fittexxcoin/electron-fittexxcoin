        Arg notes:
        - `fee_calc_timeout` is used when computing the fee (which is done
          asynchronously in another thread) to limit the total amount of time in
          seconds spent waiting for fee calculation. The timeout is a total time
          allotment for this function call. (The reason the fee calc can take a
          long time is for some pathological tx's, it is very slow to calculate
          fee as it involves deserializing prevout_tx from the wallet, for each
          input).
        - `download_inputs`, if True, will allow for more accurate fee data to
          be exported with the history by using the Transaction class input
          fetcher to download *all* prevout_hash tx's for inputs (even for
          inputs not in wallet). This feature requires self.network (ie, we need
          to be online) otherwise it will behave as if download_inputs=False.
        - `progress_callback`, if specified, is a callback which receives a
          single float argument in the range [0.0,1.0] indicating how far along
          the history export is going. This is intended for interop with GUI
          code. Node the progress callback is not guaranteed to be called in the
          context of the main thread, therefore GUI code should use appropriate
          signals/slots to update the GUI with progress info.

        Note on side effects: This function may update self.tx_fees. Rationale:
        it will spend some time trying very hard to calculate accurate fees by
        examining prevout_tx's (leveraging the fetch_input_data code in the
        Transaction class). As such, it is worthwhile to cache the results in
        self.tx_fees, which gets saved to wallet storage. This is not very
        demanding on storage as even for very large wallets with huge histories,
        tx_fees does not use more than a few hundred kb of space. '''
